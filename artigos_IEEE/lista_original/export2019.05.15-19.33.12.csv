The Role of OAIS Representation Information in the Digital Curation of Crystallography Data,M. Patel; S. Coles; D. Giaretta; S. Rankin; B. McIlwrath,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2009 Fifth IEEE International Conference on e-Science,,2009,,,132,139,"Reusable high quality data are emerging as the raw material of contemporary e-science. Large volumes of scientific data are now ¿born-digital¿ and need to be curated to facilitate use and reuse. Representation Information (RI) as defined by the OAIS Reference Model is increasingly recognised as being vital to the long term curation and preservation of meaningful and reliable digital data. This paper is concerned with an investigation of RI for crystallography data and its role in the curation, maintenance and management of such data. We describe how the explicit recording of relevant RI can facilitate long term access and maintain intelligibility of the Crystallographic Information File format (a critical file format in the crystallography domain).",,978-1-4244-5340-5978-0-7695-3877,10.1109/e-Science.2009.27,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380876,Digital curation;Preservation;Crystallography data;Representation Information;OAIS Reference Model,Crystallography;Raw materials;Maintenance;Hardware;Materials science and technology;Councils;Instruments;Memory;Grid computing;Data analysis,information retrieval systems,OAIS representation information;digital curation;crystallography data;reusable high quality data;crystallographic information file format;digital data;contemporary e-science,,1,26,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The Architecture and Design of a Community-Based Cloud Platform for Curating Big Data,S. K. Sowe; K. Zettsu,NA; NA,2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery,,2013,,,171,178,"The digital universe is exponentially producing unprecedented volume of data that has brought benefits, as well as fundamental challenges for the research community. This trend is inherently exciting for the development and deployment of cloud platforms to support research communities curate data. The excitements stems from the fact that researchers can now have more access and discover more value in data, establish relationships between bits and pieces of information from many types of data, and collaborate with a diverse community of researchers from various domains. Technically, however, platform providers must design their infrastructure in such a way that users can easily search, find, share, and seamlessly collaborate. In this paper, we present the architecture and design of a cloud platform and describe how a community of disaster response scientists could use the platform to curate data. Motivation for developing the platform, lessons learnt in overcoming some challenges associated with collaborative and cooperative cloud environments, and future research directions are also presented. The contribution of this research is in the field of cloud infrastructure for supporting data curation activities, and the sustenance of research communities for the utilization of information assets and cyber technologies.",,978-0-7695-5106,10.1109/CyberC.2013.35,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685676,Cloud computing;Big data;Data curation;Scientific communities;Collaborative environments,Communities;Information management;Data handling;Data storage systems;Clouds;Information services;Collaboration,cloud computing;data handling;disasters;emergency management,community-based cloud platform;big data curation;digital universe;research communities;platform providers;disaster response scientists;cooperative cloud environments;collaborative cloud environments;information assets;cyber technologies,,3,30,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The software platform, called eGor, allows users to define test procedures and components through a user friendly access point. Specific experiment definitions can be saved for later use or recalled as templates for modified tests. The user can then remotely execute the test on any connected physical experiment workbench in a real lab environment. Once the test is complete, eGor will capture an organized and metadata-rich research object that includes the raw test data, detailed definition of the test setup, and all procedural elements of the executed test such as the timings, test successions, device conditions, etc. The generated research object are stored for subsequent curating or data analysis, and any access or treatment of the results is automatically recorded to maintain data provenance. eGor also allows stored research objects to be shared with collaborators or provided to any institution that would be interested in reproducing the same results. The results may be inspected at various levels of detail, annotated and compared with other research objects. Thus, eGor would help researchers increase their confidence in their results and conclusions and promote improved research reproducibility. During this demonstrations the users will be allowed to interact with hardware blocks that mimic a simple lab setup, and the users may define, schedule and perform tests using these devices and save their test results as research objects.",2379-447X,978-1-4673-6853-7978-1-5090-1427,10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050711,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8050711,,,computerised instrumentation;data acquisition;data analysis;data integrity;electrochemical sensors,automated data acquisition;digital curation platform;research precision;research productivity;research reproducibility;data provenance;electrochemical sensor system;eGor software platform;data analysis,,1,1,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Entity Resolution in the Web of Data,V. Christophides; V. Efthymiou; K. Stefanidis,"Computer Science at the University of Crete.; University of Crete and a member of the Information Systems Laboratory of the Institute of Computer Science at FORTH.; ICS-FORTH, Greece.",Entity Resolution in the Web of Data,,2015,,,,,"In recent years, several knowledge bases have been built to enable large-scale knowledge sharing, but also an entity-centric Web search, mixing both structured data and text querying. These knowledge bases offer machine-readable descriptions of real-world entities, e.g., persons, places, published on the Web as Linked Data. However, due to the different information extraction tools and curation policies employed by knowledge bases, multiple, complementary and sometimes conflicting descriptions of the same real-world entities may be provided. Entity resolution aims to identify different descriptions that refer to the same entity appearing either within or across knowledge bases. The objective of this book is to present the new entity resolution challenges stemming from the openness of the Web of data in describing entities by an unbounded number of knowledge bases, the semantic and structural diversity of the descriptions provided across domains even for the same real-world entities, as well as the autonomy of knowledge bases in terms of adopted processes for creating and curating entity descriptions. The scale, diversity, and graph structuring of entity descriptions in the Web of data essentially challenge how two descriptions can be effectively compared for similarity, but also how resolution algorithms can efficiently avoid examining pairwise all descriptions. The book covers a wide spectrum of entity resolution issues at the Web scale, including basic concepts and data structures, main resolution tasks and workflows, as well as state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and experimental trade-offs.",,"9,78162705804916E+020",,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org,entity resolution;Web of data,,,,,,,,,,,Morgan & Claypool,
Towards a Hybrid Human-Computer Scientific Information Extraction Pipeline,R. B. Tchoua; K. Chard; D. J. Audus; L. T. Ward; J. Lequieu; J. J. De Pablo; I. T. Foster,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on e-Science (e-Science),,2017,,,109,118,"The emerging field of materials informatics has the potential to greatly reduce time-to-market and development costs for new materials. The success of such efforts hinges on access to large, high-quality databases of material properties. However, many such data are only to be found encoded in text within esoteric scientific articles, a situation that makes automated extraction difficult and manual extraction time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we present a hybrid Information Extraction (IE) pipeline to improve the machine-human partnership with respect to extraction quality and person-hours, through a combination of rule-based, machine learning, and crowdsourcing approaches. Our goal is to leverage computer and human strengths to alleviate the burden on human curators by automating initial extraction tasks before prioritizing and assigning specialized curation tasks to humans with different levels of training: using non-experts for straightforward tasks such as validation of higher accuracy results (e.g., completing partial facts) and domain experts for low-certainty results (e.g., reviewing specialized compound labels). To validate our approaches, we focus on the task of extracting the glass transition temperature of polymers from published articles. Applying our approaches to 6 090 articles, we have so far extracted 259 refined data values. We project that this number will grow considerably as we tune our methods and process more articles, to exceed that found in standard, expert-curated polymer data handbooks while also being easier to keep up-to-date.

Data curation with a focus on reuse,M. Esteva; S. Sweat; R. McLay; W. Xu; S. Kulasekaran,"Texas Advanced Computing Center, Austin, Texas; University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas; Texas Advanced Computing Center, Austin, Texas; Texas Advanced Computing Center, Austin, Texas; Texas Advanced Computing Center, Austin, Texas",2016 IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL),,2016,,,45,54,"A dataset from the field of High Performance Computing (HPC) was curated with the focus on facilitating its reuse and to appeal to a broader audience beyond HPC specialists. At an early stage in the research project, the curators gathered requirements from prospective users of the dataset, focusing on how and for which research projects they would reuse the data. Users needs informed which curation tasks to conduct, which included: adding more information elements to the dataset to expand its content scope; removing personal information; and, packaging the data in a size, a format, and at a frequency of delivery that are convenient for access and analysis purposes. The curation tasks are embedded in the software that produces the data, and are implemented as an automated workflow that spans various HPC resources, in which the dataset is generated, processed and stored and the Texas ScholarWorks institutional repository, through which the data is published. Within this distributed architecture, the integrated data creation and curation workflow complies with long-term preservation requirements, and is the first one implemented as a collaboration between the supercomputing center where the data is created on ongoing basis, and the University Libraries at UT Austin where it is published. The targeted curation strategy included the design of proof of concept data analyses to evaluate if the curated data met the reuse scenarios proposed by users. The results suggest that the dataset is understandable, and that researchers can use it to answer some of the research questions they posed. Results also pointed to specific elements of the curation strategy that had to be improved and disclosed the difficulties involved in breaking data to new users.",,978-1-4503-4229-2978-1-5090-5254,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559563,Data curation;high performance computing;distributed collections architecture;data publishing and reuse,Software;Supercomputers;Distributed databases;Libraries;Metadata;High performance computing,data analysis;parallel machines;parallel processing;software architecture,high performance computing;data reuse;personal information removal;data packaging;data access;data analysis;automated workflow;HPC resources;Texas ScholarWorks institutional repository;distributed architecture;integrated data creation workflow;integrated data curation workflow;long-term preservation requirements;supercomputing center;University Libraries,,,36,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Each photograph is represented by a row in the spreadsheet. One column gives the file name where the photo is stored, and the other columns give the metadata (date, species, etc.). Once the data is in the spreadsheet, they can select and group photos of interest and compute relevant statistics. In this paper, we describe Photospread in more detail.

Autonomic Curation of Crowdsourced Knowledge: The Case of Career Data Management,A. Patelli; P. Lewis; H. Wang; I. Nabney; D. Bennett; R. Lucas; A. Cole,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2016 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC),,2016,,,40,49,"Automatically curating knowledge that is available online is a pressing necessity, given the exponential increase in the volume of data published over the web. However, the solutions presently available are yet to reach the same level of support quality provided by human curators. This is mainly due to the fact that digital database managers do not take the expertise of the interested community into account nor exploit the underlying connections between knowledge pieces when processing user queries. We propose an approach to bridge the gap between automated curation and the one provided by human experts and implement it in the field of career data management. The resulting platform, Aviator, is based on an ontology powered autonomic manager which produces complete, intuitive and relevant answers to career related queries, in a time effective manner.
